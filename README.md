**A python package demo for spatially informed TSP**
-   Free software: MIT License
-   Documentation: https://whkim15.github.io/spatialtsp

## Aim of this package
-   Aims to increase computing performance while ensuring optimal solutions for TSP solution.
-   Application of the spatial partitioning informed approach. Applies Spatial Adjacency (Voronoi polygons) & Proximity Searching Methods (K-NN) to define connections among nodes


## Features
-   Generate distance matrix based on the spatial information
-   Analyze Traveling Salesman Problem

## Demos
-   Successfully worked in simulating toy data consisting of from 10 to 50 points(100 times of each toy data)
-   Successfully worked in the real data(48 Capitals of USA)
